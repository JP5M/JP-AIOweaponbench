# JP-AIOweaponbench

This is a **forked version** of the original [OT_weaponrepair](https://github.com/OTSTUDIOS/OT_weaponrepair) by OTSTUDIOS, maintained and extended by **JP5M**.

## About

A simple weapon repair script for ox_inventory, using ox_lib for the menu system. This fork introduces new features such as **Serial Number Scratching** and **Weapon Tampering**, in addition to the original functionality:

- Specify a global required item to repair, or set unique required items for specific weapons.
- Configure as many repair locations as you want.
- Optionally require the repair bench prop to be spawned.

## New Features in This Fork

- **Serial Number Scratching:** Redact or remove weapon serial numbers at the bench.
- **Weapon Tampering:** Additional menu options for advanced weapon modifications (feature in progress).
